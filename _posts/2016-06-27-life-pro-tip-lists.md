Sharing a Pro Tip with you guys: Lists. 

Lists, specifically to-do lists are very powerful - they allow us to take things off the mind, but them onto paper (or an app) and we now only have to remember one thing - to look at the list. But this isn't just some rambling from a late-twenties aspiring entreupenuer; Leonardo Da Vinci was also a big user:

I love the care he has taken in drawing pictures of the groceries.

In some kind of list-ceptin, we have a top 10 tips from Richard Branson for making lists below. I include him as I read his autobiography - Losing My Virginity (the name still makes me smile) and the power and importance of lists was one of the biggest take-aways. He would speak to customers at airports and write down their feedback.

*I have always lived my life by making lists: lists of people to call, lists of ideas, lists of companies to set up, lists of people who can make things happen. Each day I work through these lists, and that sequence of calls propels me forward. - Richard Branson*

The structure he sets above seems really appealing to m

* Write down every single idea you have, no matter how big or small
* Always carry a notebook
* Find a list method that works for you. Doodles, bullet-points, charts what suits you best?
* Make a list of small, manageable tasks to complete every day
* Mark off every completed task youll find making each tick very satisfying
* Make your goals measurable so you know if your plans are working
* Set far off, outlandish goals. What do you want to have achieved by 2020? How about 2050?
* Include personal goals in your lists, not just business
* Share your goals with others. You can help motivate each other further
* Celebrate your successes then make new lists of new goal

I can't argue with any of the above.

We use lists (arrays) in programming, and we should use them elsewhere if we want to live productive lives too.
